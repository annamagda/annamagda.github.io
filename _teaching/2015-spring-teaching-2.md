This course introduces students to the origins and development of medical and scientific thinking about race, racialized bodies, and health inequities patterned along lines of race and ethnicity. Drawing on histories of medicine and empire; critical race theory; science and technology studies (STS); medical anthropology; and sociology of medicine the course equips students to trouble the idea of race-as-biological-difference by situating the social construction of scientific arguments about race and health in historical, political, and national context. Students learn to historicize and critique genomic and post-genomic discourses of racial difference and develop communication strategies for confronting persistent racial essentialism and racist practices in medicine with peers, healthcare professionals, and the public.
