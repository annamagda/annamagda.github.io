This course critically interrogates “global health” as a set of historically-contingent ideas, systems, and activities carried out across geographic, cultural, and economic difference. We will ask: where, how, and why did paradigmatic global health interventions emerge? What activities have been carried out in the name of health promotion and with what consequences? How have global health actors imagined the people and communities whose health they seek to improve? How do health interventions cultivate subjects and subjectivities, both normative and revolutionary? In order to answer these questions, we look to histories of empire, colonialism, and globalization; to interactions between citizens, states, civil society, multilateral organizations, and private capital; and to the development ideologies and practices that have shaped global health over the past century. Topics include tropical and missionary medicine; eradication campaigns; sanitation and segregation; reproduction; family planning; maternal health; infant nutrition; health systems and finance; racialized hierarchies of expertise and labor; primary health care and community-based programs; health education and behavior change communication; international cooperation and bilateral aid; neoliberalism; access to medicine; and the politics of care. Readings are drawn from anthropology, social history, sociology, medicine, public health, medical humanities, and science studies.
